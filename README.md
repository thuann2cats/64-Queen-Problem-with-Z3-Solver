# Experiment: 64-Queen problem with Z3 Solver

In this experiment, I used Z3 Solver to solve the N-Queens problem. Z3 Solver can solve the problem with N = 64 in just minutes.

In [this notebook](nqueens_z3_solver.ipynb), the constant `num_queens` can be set to a different N value for further experimentations. The solution is the output of the last cell in the usual format: the position of a queen in each "column" in the board.
